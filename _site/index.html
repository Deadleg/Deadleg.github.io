        <h2> Writing my Dissertation </h2>
        <h4> 18 September 2014 </h4>
        <div class="content"> <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
    In the last year I wrote my dissertation about angular the distributions of J/Psi mesons produced at the CMS. This post is not so much about the end results, but how I went about organising and writing my dissertation, and things I would have done differently. I hope this will be of use for those writing their first large reports dealing with lots of data and writing. I'm not an expert on typography and graphic design, so do not take my word as gospel. 
</p>

<h1>The Tools</h1>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>LaTeX (using textmaker)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>pgftikz</li>
                <li>listings</li>
            </ul>
            <li>ROOT</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>gnuplot</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            LaTeX was my text formatter of choice, which is the natural choice in the field of physics; the pgftikz package was used for images and some plots that weren't done in gnuplot; listings for adding colour to any code; ROOT is the analysis tool used at CERN; and Python was used to further format results produced from ROOT.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            None of these programs are particularly unique in their function or form, such as using word over LaTeX or MATLAB over Python/gnuplot. The only constraint in my choices was that I had to use use ROOT. Choosing LaTeX add another constraint, LaTeX makes documents too pretty to pass up the option.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    

<h1>Workflow</h1>

    </p>
        All of my data came from ROOT, with various analysis results being saved to file. Once all these output files were made, I wrote a Python script that manipulated this data (as opposed to doing it in ROOT since it is much easier) providing either output a LaTeX ready table or for some cases prepared a white space separated file to put into gnuplot. gnuplot was used to provide $\chi^2$ fits and plots for some of graphs, and pgfplots tikz  was used to plot data that didn't need fitting due to its slightly easier syntax. It is possible to do all of these things in ROOT, but it's much easier to use these programs plus they are latex friendly.
    </p>

    <p> 
        For the dissertation itself, almost everything I wrote (including layout changes) was written into the single main .tex file. The only bits that weren't into that main file was my code and tables processed by my Python script. In a diagram, it worked like this:
    </p>
    
    <!--Wordflow diagram-->
    <div id="diagram" class="flowchart">

        <div id="mroot" class="diagram-block">ROOT</div>

        <div id="output1" class="diagram-block">Output</div>

        <div id="python" class="diagram-block">Python</div>

            <div id="gnuplot" class="diagram-block-inline">gnuplot</div>

            <div id="textables" class="diagram-block-inline">Tex tables</div>
        
        <div></div>
        
            <div id="output2" class="diagram-block-inline">Output</div>
        
            <!--Spacer-->
            <div class="diagram-block-inline-spacer"></div>
            
        <div id="latex" class="diagram-block">LaTeX</div>

    </div>

        jsPlumb.ready(function() {

                connector: ["Bezier", { curviness: 10 }],
                anchors: ["Bottom", [0.7,0,0,-1]]
            });
            
        });
    </script> 
    
    <p>
        The end result was a working directory that contained dozens of data files with incoherent names, scripts with terrible variable names, and LaTeX labels with vague names. This resulted in the LaTeX file itself being a difficult to edit beast. Because of all these problems, the experience creating my dissertation was hampered by all of these walls I had put up myself. 
    </p>

<h1>What I would fix (and what you should do)</h1>

    <p>
        The biggest issue on the whole was not compartmentalising everything like I should have. This includes separating the main .tex files into separate smaller files that makes things easier to maintain and edit; separating data files into families either by creating a new folder to put the files in, or creating some kind of sane naming convention, or even using ROOTs internal structures; splitting up the code I used for ROOT (1000+ lines with a lot of histograms, repeated code, minimal comments) into more manageable bites.
    </p>

    <p>
        Compartmentalising makes working easier in many ways, such as being able to troubleshoot code since it will be contained into smaller bits, including/remove parts you don't need, and reusing bits you have used before. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In all code I wrote (including LaTeX), I wish I wrote more comments. This is not unique to just research, but *any* programming you do. Even if you're the only person who will read it, there will come a point where you put aside some bit code for an extended period of time, after which you'll come back to it and find you have no idea what you wrote. You may have some vague recollections, but you'll waste time relearning this piece of code because of the lack of documentation, incoherent variable names, and sometimes just weird bits that look right. Comment, comment, comment. This cannot be emphasised enough.

        <div class="content"> <h2>Why LaTeX over Word?</h2>

<div>
    <p>
        This is something that I find to be vitally important when presenting and kind of information. From every document that I've seen, every LaTeX document looks much much nicer than any word document. It may be that you can produce documents of a similar quality in word, but from what I've seen from my partners dissertation written in word, it would require much more effort.
    </p>

    <p>
        Having a nice looking document does multiple things for you:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>It makes it more readable. Legibility may not be that important for you since you'll rarely read your writing in one large block, but who ever ends up reading (and marking) it will end up having a more pleasant time and thus give you a better mark (maybe).</li>
        <li>It allows the content of your work to stand out more instead of hiding behind unintentional design and typographic faux pas.</li>
        <li>It gives you something you can look at and be proud of, even if you've written a load of shit. It will be a pretty pile of shit at the very least.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Aim for advice given for writing CV's. Along the lines of less is more, put organise content into minimal but presentable sections, don't over do it, etc. If you have ever done marking, you will appreciate the difference between clean assignments, and terrible handwritten or verbose assignments.
    <p>

    <p>
        There are many articles discussing the motivation for using LaTeX over word, including (but not exhaustive):
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Superior text formatting.</li>
        <li>Ability to modularise almost everything</li>
        <li>Easier to use version control with</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        My only reason to use it is for the text formatting. Since I saw my first LaTeX document at university I loved how it looked. I could not my finger on it, but it just looked... nice. I did not take advantage of the latter two points, and that is something I definitely would do differently.
