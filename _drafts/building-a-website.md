title: Building and deploying a website
---

As a full stack developer you will have done work from the database to the frontend, and possibly with the infrastructure as well (particularely cloud based IaaS). If you are not a full stack developer but rather focus some the frontend/backend etc. then you will not have the breadth of knowledge when it comes to how your work interacts with other aspects of the system.

In this guide I want to briefly go through each of the steps

<!--end excerpt-->

The context of the guide is as follows:

- You are wanting to build a website that talks to a database.
- You want to develop the backend and frontend.
- You want to manage the deployment of the website.
- You want to be able to resolve issues in production.
