<h2>Why LaTeX over Word?</h2>

<div>
    <p>
        This is something that I find to be vitally important when presenting and kind of information. From every document that I've seen, every LaTeX document looks much much nicer than any word document. It may be that you can produce documents of a similar quality in word, but from what I've seen from my partners dissertation written in word, it would require much more effort.
    </p>

    <p>
        Having a nice looking document does multiple things for you:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>It makes it more readable. Legibility may not be that important for you since you'll rarely read your writing in one large block, but who ever ends up reading (and marking) it will end up having a more pleasant time and thus give you a better mark (maybe).</li>
        <li>It allows the content of your work to stand out more instead of hiding behind unintentional design and typographic faux pas.</li>
        <li>It gives you something you can look at and be proud of, even if you've written a load of shit. It will be a pretty pile of shit at the very least.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Aim for advice given for writing CV's. Along the lines of less is more, put organise content into minimal but presentable sections, don't over do it, etc. If you have ever done marking, you will appreciate the difference between clean assignments, and terrible handwritten or verbose assignments.
    <p>

    <p>
        There are many articles discussing the motivation for using LaTeX over word, including (but not exhaustive):
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Superior text formatting.</li>
        <li>Ability to modularise almost everything</li>
        <li>Easier to use version control with</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        My only reason to use it is for the text formatting. Since I saw my first LaTeX document at university I loved how it looked. I could not my finger on it, but it just looked... nice. I did not take advantage of the latter two points, and that is something I definitely would do differently.
